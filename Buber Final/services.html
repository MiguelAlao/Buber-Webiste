        <h2>  How does it work? </h2>
        <br>
        <h2><p>Our goal is to provide a service where everybody can assume a very important role, without being part of BUBER company. For that you will need to check our website and then you will be able to understand what is this about.</p>
        <p>So, let us explain a bit... <br>
        With BUBER website you can become an employe just for the amount of time you want to and perform the services (mostly deliveries) as long as you want to, then when you were finished with the tasks you picked up, those services will be analyzed, just to confirm if everything went as the customer expected and the payment will be done straight away.</p>
        <p>However, please note that the fact of being able to pick up "temporary jobs(tasks)", is only one part of BUBER services, as you can be delivering something to a customer and then, when you arrive home, you can also proceed and order whatever you want to be delivered at your place (just keep in mind that deliveries will be done by bicycle).
        This way, you will go from person who is providing the service to the one that is requesting something, in no time.</p></h2>
